This project explores customer purchase behavior by building and comparing predictive models using Poisson and Negative Binomial (NBD) distributions. Through Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and regression models, it examines key predictors such as race, country, and region and analyzes overdispersion in count data. The project includes model evaluations using AIC and BIC for optimal model selection and offers actionable insights for enhancing customer engagement strategies in e-commerce.
